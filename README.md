# 100Day-Challenge
A 100-day journey into GPU programming using CUDA, HIP, and Triton. This repo features daily kernel implementations covering vector ops, deep learning layers, optimization techniques, and custom GPU algorithms. Inspired by the PMPP book, with performance-focused code for both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
